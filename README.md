# Deck of Cards Template Repo

# Instructions  

## This assignment is to be done in vanilla Javascript. Without using any non standard external libraries

### Description:
1. You display the 52 cards in a standard playing cards deck ‘scatteredʼ on the 
screen on the page. 
2. At the bottom of the screen, have four ‘cardholdersʼ - each labeled after a 
house of cards - spade, diamond, clubs, hearts. 
3. The user can ‘clean upʼ space by dragging a card and dropping it into the right 
cardholder. 
4. On the second login, the game should start from where they left off. 
5. Notes: You can only place a card in the correct cardholder. Spades in 
spades, hearts in hearts, etc. 
6. If all cards are put into the right cardholder, show a “restart” button. If clicked, 
the cards should be again shuffled in the space above.
